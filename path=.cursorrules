# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification
The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot
screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM
response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- **Verify Field Types:** Double-check Hygraph schema not just for field API IDs but also their *types* (e.g., Relation, String, List of Strings). Assuming a field is a relation when it's a simple type (like `sections` being an array instead of linking to UseCases) leads to incorrect GraphQL queries and 400 errors when trying to access nested fields. Test simple field access first in the playground.
- **Unique Fields for Filtering:** When querying a single item (e.g., `model(where: { ... })`), the `where` clause requires a field marked as unique in the schema (like `id`). For filtering by non-unique fields (like `slug` in this case), use the plural query (`models(where: { nonUniqueField: ... }, first: 1)`).
- **Verify Plural Query Names:** Hygraph automatically generates plural query names (e.g., `useCases` becomes `useCaseS`). Always verify the exact capitalization and spelling in the Hygraph API playground before using it in the frontend code. Using the wrong name (e.g., `useCases` instead of `useCaseS`) will result in a 400 Bad Request error.

# Scratchpad: Hygraph Data Population Plan

**Goal:** Populate Hygraph with detailed technology information, including nested use cases, architectures, components, flows, metrics, and implementation details.

**Key Mutations Used:**

1.  **`updateTechnology` (for adding nested Use Case, Architecture, Components, Flow):**
    *   Targets an existing `Technology` record by ID (e.g., Weaviate `id: "cm5c8if6q7p9m07looqyq23aq"`).
    *   Uses nested `create` within the `data` argument.
    *   **Structure Example:**
        ```graphql
        mutation AddUseCaseDeep($techId: ID!, ...) { ... }
        ```

2.  **`updateUseCase` (for adding details to a specific Use Case):**
    *   Targets an existing `UseCase` record by ID (e.g., Med Image Classification `id: "cm9jbv6kphejm08lfwca1mqqh"`).
    *   Used to add fields like `implementation` (JSON) and `metrics` (`[String!]!`).
    *   **Structure Example:**
        ```graphql
        mutation AddUseCaseDetails($useCaseId: ID!, $implementationData: Json!, $metricsList: [String!]!) { ... }
        ```

3.  **`updateTechnology` (for updating top-level Technology fields):**
    *   Targets an existing `Technology` record by ID.
    *   Used to add/update fields like `businessMetrics` (which was `String`, not `[String!]!`).
    *   **Structure Example:**
        ```graphql
        mutation AddBusinessMetrics($techId: ID!, $metricsString: String!) { ... }
        ```

**Common Pitfalls & Lessons Learned:**

*   **Schema vs. Variables:** Always double-check the exact field type in the Hygraph schema (e.g., `String`, `Json`, `[String!]!`) and ensure the GraphQL mutation variable type matches (`String!`, `Json!`, `[String!]!`). Mismatches cause errors (like the `businessMetrics` String vs. Array issue).
*   **List Formatting:** Provide list inputs directly as JSON arrays (e.g., `"field": ["item1", "item2"]`).
*   **JSON Formatting:** Ensure JSON data for `Json` fields is valid JSON.
*   **Connecting Relations:** Use the `{ connect: { id: "..." } }` syntax within the `data` object to link to existing records. Check the schema's `WhereUniqueInput` type for the relation to see if connecting by other fields (like `slug`) is possible.
*   **Publishing Status:** Content created/updated via mutations might initially be in the `DRAFT` stage. Ensure records (Technology, UseCase, etc.) are **Published** in the Hygraph UI to be visible to standard read queries.
*   **GraphQL Caching:** Client-side libraries (like `graphql-request`) often cache query results. Stale data can cause confusion after mutations.
    *   **Debugging:** Use hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R), check network requests.
    *   **Fix (Temporary):** Disable cache via client config (`fetchOptions: { cache: 'no-store' }` for `graphql-request`).
    *   **Fix (Robust):** Implement proper cache invalidation strategies if using a more advanced client (like Apollo Client).
    *   **Fix (Header):** Explicitly request the desired stage using the `gcms-stage: PUBLISHED` header in the client config.
*   **Frontend Data Merging:** Be cautious when merging data from multiple sources (e.g., Hygraph + local constants). Ensure the merge logic correctly prioritizes data and handles potential type mismatches or null values. Use spread syntax carefully (`{ ...localData, ...hygraphData }` prioritizes `hygraphData` for overlapping simple fields).
*   **Frontend Rendering:** Add type checks (`typeof`, `Array.isArray`) before using type-specific methods (`.split()`, `.map()`) to prevent runtime errors when data might have unexpected types due to merging or API inconsistencies.

**Summary of Recent Progress:**

*   Completed foundational setup and refactoring.
*   Implemented dynamic navigation using Hygraph data.
*   Enhanced the `/industries` overview page.
*   Defined a phased roadmap.
*   **Created the dedicated `/usecases` page, fetching and displaying dynamic use case data (title, description, industry, technologies) in a grid layout.**
*   **Updated the header navigation to link to the new `/usecases` page.**
